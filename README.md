# Battleship

Welcome to Battleship! This is a 2-person game where you each have your own map to place your ships!
You will both get 3 ships: 1 **[Battleship]**, 1 **[Carrier]**, and 1 **[Destroyer]**. The **[Battleship]** has a
size of 4 tiles, the **[Carrier]** has a size of 5 tiles, and the **[Destroyer]** has a size of 2 tiles. You can
place them anywhere on your (9x9) map either horizontally or vertically and so can the other player.
Every turn, each player must decide which coordinates (e.g. A1) to send their missile. Every 'miss' is represented
by an 'm', while every hit is represented with an 'x'! You must hit all the tiles
containing the ship in order to sink the ship. Once all opposing ships are sunk (by whichever player),
the game will end. GLHF!

Each board will look like this (with your missile missing on A1):
